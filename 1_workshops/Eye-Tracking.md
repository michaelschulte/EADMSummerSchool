## EADM Summer School in Salzburg: Eye-Tracking

### Goal

The workshop will provide a general overview of the research method “eye tracking” - including the following points. 

### What is going to happen

We will learn about the most important measures, such as 
- fixation durations, fixation probabilities
- scan paths 
- pupil size 

and concepts, such as
- the perceptual span
- parafoveal preprocessing

We will consider and compare different options (and systems) 
- EyeLink
- Tobii
- desktop-mounted / head-mounted / remote-options

… and which of them are particularly suited for different applications / areas of research 
- e.g. research with children

I will briefly present selected studies from which I believe that they are especially well designed and/or of particular interest. 

We will consider experimental paradigms of eye movement research, such as
- gaze-contingent techniques
- moving window technique
- invisible boundary paradigm 

... and the options (software) for programming eye tracking experiments
 -	Experiment Builder
 -	Pygaze (OpenSesame)

We may visit the laboratories for a “hands-on” session and have an interactive session in which we discuss the commonalities and differences / the advantages and disadvantages of eye tracking versus MouseLab

Finally, we learn about advanced methods, such as
- the co-registration of eye movements with EEG
- the co-registration of eye movements with fMRI
