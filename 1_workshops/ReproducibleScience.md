## EADM Summer School in Salzburg: Open science practices for future-proof research

The standards for psychological research are shifting. After several large-scale replication projects in the last years suggested that the results of more than 50% of published studies cannot be reproduced, psychologists have taken action: New practices and tools have been developed to maximise transparency and reproducibility of the research process, and they are quickly setting new norms.

Growing numbers of researchers share their data and study materials on public repositories, use reproducible analysis scripts, preregister their hypotheses, methods, and planned analyses before collecting data, and join forces with other labs to gather larger samples and increase statistical power. Perhaps more importantly for individual researchers, some of these practics are increasingly being required by journals and funding agencies. 

The goal of this workshop is to show how we can future-proof our research with transparent, reproducible methods, leading to results with a low risk of fooling ourselves and others.
We will first take a brief look at the causes of the replication crisis and then cover the basics of preregistration, data sharing, and reproducible analyses, including an introduction to the [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io) (OSF). Participants will gain basic knowledge of open science practices and associated techniques and tools to make their own research more transparent and reproducible.
