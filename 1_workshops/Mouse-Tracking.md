## EADM Summer School in Salzburg: Mouse-Tracking 

### Goal
Design, build, pre-register, run, and analyze a mouse-tracking experiment in small groups (of 4 to 5 people).  

### Types of experiments considered
To facilitate the creation of the experiments during the workshop and to make them suitable for an investigation via mouse-tracking, they should meet the following criteria:
* In the experiment, participants complete a number of trials that involve decisions of the same structure
* In each trial, participants have to decide between two options by clicking on the corresponding button (two-alternative forced choice task, 2AFC)
* Between trials, the stimulus to be decided upon varies (usually) and / or the two response categories
* The stimulus (and/or the response options - in case they vary) should be simple (e.g., a single word, a picture)

### Preparations
* Read book chapters [Kieslich et al., 2018](../3_literature/Kieslich2018.pdf)
* Outline two example experiments in your group (meeting the requirements outlined above) and describe them in a paragraph
* Upload your ideas in one file name 'GroupX.doc' (where X is your group number) onto OSF [Project Ideas](https://osf.io/c86f7/)
