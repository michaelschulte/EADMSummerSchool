## EADM Summer School in Salzburg: Mouse-Tracking 

### Preparations
* Read book chapters (Kieslich et al., 2018; Wulff et al., 2018)
* Paragraph with question to answer with mousetracking (communicate restrictions in terms of setup etc) (@Michael: what do you mean with this? -> provided that participants do their own study there should be restrictions for setup (eg 2 boxes) and number of trials etc)

### Goal
Design, build, pre-register, run, and analyze a mouse-tracking experiment in small groups (of 4 to 5 people).  

### Monday (Pascal)
* 13:00-14:00 General introduction to mouse-tracking 
* 14:00-16:00 Introduction to task
  * What experiments are considered (2AFC, stimuli, etc.)
  * Examples
* 16:00-17:00 Develop experimental design conceptually
* 17:00-18:00 Present experimental design in plenum 

### Tuesday (Pascal)
* 09:00-10:30 OpenSesame & mousetrap-os introduction
* 10:30-12:00 Build experiment
* 13:00-14:00 Build experiment
* 14:00-15:00 Register experiment at OSF
