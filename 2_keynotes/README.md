### Human rationality: Three gaps and no funeral 

In this talk, I am concerned with three seemingly conflicting sets of findings, interpretations and conclusions in reseach on behavioral decision making. Beginning with the description-experience gap in contemporary research on human choice, I argue that experienced-based decisions result, at least to some extent, in systematically different behaviors than description-based decisions. Taking advantage of this distinction, I then turn to what one may call a gap in human (bounded) rationality that emerges once two research programs are compared: the intuitive statistican program and the heuristics-and-biases program. Finally, I propose that this rationality gap has given rise to two distinct approaches to public policy interventions, based on behavioral science evidence demonstrating people’s decision making competences or lack thereof: the nudging and the boosting approach. In my view, there are good reasons and evidence for the respective intellectual positons—that is to say, no funeral is being proposed—but it is important to understand these sustained and profound different portrayals of the human mind and their methodological and theoretical origins.

### Empowering patients and doctors to make better decisions

The main goal of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy is to help people in their struggle to understand and assess the risks they face and to make sound decisions under uncertainty. Our main focus is on health and medicine. By conducting studies, experiments, and surveys, we investigate people's problems with understanding numbers and dealing with uncertainty and find solutions to these. In my talk, I will discuss some of our experimental work as well as some of our collaborations with different health care institutions (e.g., health insurances) to demonstrate how we can help doctors and patients make sense of health statistics and improve their decision making. I will also present ready-to-use evidence-based and data-driven decision tools for doctors and patients that empower both experts and lay-people to make better medical decisions.
