# ToDos

You will work on your tasks in 5 groups [Groups.md](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/tree/master/Groups.md). 

- We will ask you to read a few papers in preparation. The number of papers is intentionally kept low so that you actually will read them!

    - For the Mouse-tracking workshop: [Kieslich et al., 2018](../3_literature/Kieslich2018.pdf)
    - For the Stewart keynote: Bhatia, S., & Stewart, N.  (in press). [Naturalistic multiattribute choice](../3_literature/Bhatia2018.pdf). Cognition.
    - For the Fiedler keynote: no reading!
    - For the Hertwig keynote: Hertwig, R., Hogarth, R. M., & Lejarraga, T. (2018). [Experience and description: exploring two paths to knowledge](../3_literature/Hertwig2018.pdf). Current Directions in Psychological Science. Advance online publication.
    - For the Jenny keynote: As preparation please also checkout the Harding center webpage on [fact-boxes](https://www.harding-center.mpg.de/en/fact-boxes) and [algorithms](https://www.harding-center.mpg.de/en/harding-center/projects-and-collaborations/algorithms-for-clinical-use). 

- Each group will plan, register, setup, run, analyse and present an experiment using Mouse-Tracking. Most of this work will be done during the first three days of the summer school. Presentations will be on Saturday afternoon.
- The groups (in a little different setup so that we have four instead of five groups) will introduce one of the keynote speakers. 
    - Group 1 + r.i.kodapanakkal will introduce Stewart 
    - Group 2 + thomas.woiczyk -> Fiedler
    - Group 3 + agnieszka.kitkowska -> Hertwig 
    - Group 4 + cathrin.schoedler -> Jenny
The introductions should not last longer than 2-3 minutes. It is common to say a bit about the speakers CV, highlight places he/she has worked and than home in on the place he/she is working now. You might ad info on important contributions, personal andecdotes (the good ones only!). Please be aware that this is not your show but the keynote speakers' so keep it short and sweet.
- Still a different setup of participants will meet with the keynote speakers after their lecture in our [MeetTheScientist](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/tree/master/MeetTheScientist.md) session.
