# ToDos

You will work on your tasks in 5 groups [Groups.md](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/blob/master/0_general/Groups.md). 

- We will ask you to read a few papers in preparation. The number of papers is intentionally kept low so that you actually will read them!

    - For the Mouse-tracking workshop: [Kieslich et al., 2018](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/blob/master/3_literature/Kieslich2018.pdf)
    - For the DfE workshop: [Hertwig et al.,2009](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/blob/master/3_literature/Hertwig2009.pdf)
    
    - For the Stewart keynote: [Bhatia, et al, in press](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/blob/master/3_literature/Bhatia2018.pdf)
    - For the Fiedler keynote: no reading!
    - For the Hertwig keynote: [Hertwig et al., 2018](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/blob/master/3_literature/Hertwig2018.pdf)
    - For the Jenny keynote: Please checkout the Harding center webpage on [fact-boxes](https://www.harding-center.mpg.de/en/fact-boxes) and [algorithms](https://www.harding-center.mpg.de/en/harding-center/projects-and-collaborations/algorithms-for-clinical-use). 

- The groups (in a little different setup so that we have four instead of five groups) will introduce one of the keynote speakers. 
    - Group 1 + r.i.kodapanakkal will introduce Stewart 
    - Group 2 + thomas.woiczyk -> Fiedler
    - Group 3 + agnieszka.kitkowska -> Hertwig 
    - Group 4 + cathrin.schoedler -> Jenny
    
The introductions should not last longer than 2-3 minutes. It is common to say a bit about the speakers' CV, highlight places he/she has worked and than home in on the place he/she is working now. You might ad info on important contributions, personal anecdotes (the good ones only!). Please be aware that this is not your show but the keynote speakers' so keep it short and sweet.

- Still a different setup of participants will meet with the keynote speakers after their lecture in our [MeetTheScientist](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/tree/master/0_general/MeetTheScientist.md) session.

- Each group will plan, register, setup, run, analyse and present an experiment using Mouse-Tracking. Most of this work will be done during the first three days of the summer school and we will introduce the details to you on the first morning. As preparation for this part please read [Kieslich et al., 2018](https://github.com/michaelschulte/EADMSummerSchool/blob/master/3_literature/Kieslich2018.pdf). Presentations will be on Saturday afternoon.
