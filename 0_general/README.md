Institut für Psychologie

Hellbrunnerstr. 34

5020 Salzburg

Given that you enter the building from the front (Hellbrunnerstr) you go into the main building, take the stairs to your right **2 flights up** to the 2nd Floor - we will be in **Rooms 424 and 425**
Or if you come from the 'Hintereingang' (which is admittedly the nicer walk/side of the Uni) you go in and take the stairs to you left :)
