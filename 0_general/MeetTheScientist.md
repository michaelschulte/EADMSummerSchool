## EADM Summer School 2018 - Meet the scientist

- We will provide you the opportunity to talk to one of the keynote speakers in a small group of five people for approx. 1 hour. This allows you to ask questions about the talk, get advice for your career ... pick the brain of the keynote speakers! 

To get a (somewhat) fair distribution of interests/speakers we ask you to  indicate your preferences for meeting the keynote speakers from 1 to 4 (1 being the highest preference).
