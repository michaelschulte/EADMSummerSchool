# EADM Summer School 2018 - Meet the scientist

The meeting is supposed to last for 45-60 minutes and give you 5:1 time with an eminent scholar in the JDM field. The idea is that you have a more private opportunity to ask questions, discuss the talk, other topics that you find interesting, get career advice ... . We suggest that you do a short round of introductions at the beginning, so that our keynote speakers know who you are - the rest is up to you.

More info in the keynotes can be found in the [Keynotes Folder](/2_keynotes).

Here is the list according to your preferences for the **Meet the scientist** session (we managed to stay in everybodies first or second preference - which is great).
